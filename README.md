# Cryptowiki

> Keep your friends close, your enemies closer, your coins safe and your keys in your underwear...

Useful shit for (un)certain times:

- [Cryptowiki](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md): Useful tools, charts, no kyc resources, people to follow, thigns to learn
- [Public watch list](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/publicwatchlist.md): Self-explantory, highly subjective

Other useful rubbish: 

- [Books and presentations](https://github.com/serejandmyself/Books-and-Presentations): Web3 presentations mainly, free to use
- [Citizen Cosmos](https://www.citizencosmos.space/): My claim to normailty where I co-host a podcast 
- [Privacy basics](https://github.com/serejandmyself/privacy-basics): Don't mix this up with security 
- [Programming learning](https://github.com/serejandmyself/Programming-learning): Meh... helps to at least, practise 
- [Social engineering](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/tree/master/research/social%20engineering): My take on social engineering
- [The no bullshit blog](https://serejandmyself.github.io/): My blog. A very subjective point of view on shit
