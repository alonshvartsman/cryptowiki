# Cryptowiki

> Keep your friends close, your enemies closer, your coins safe and your keys in your underwear...

Useful shit for (un)certain times:

- [Cryptowiki](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md): Useful tools, charts, no kyc resources, people to follow, thigns to learn
- [Public watch list](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/publicwatchlist.md): Self-explantory, highly subjective

To add: books and presentations, research, papers(?), other useful crap
